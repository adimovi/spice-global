No arguing, no arguments, just good by.\n             </p>\n             <p>\n             That’s because I won’t allow anyone to bring down our good name or the effort of all other partners and stakeholders under any circumstances. If a mistake is made with the best intentions and effort, that is no problem, but carelessness, stupidity or laziness will never be tolerated, whether it comes from a cleaner, a CEO or anyone in between.\n             </p>\n             <p>\n             A good reliable cleaner who brings a positive attitude to their work environment is worth a thousand times the value and respect of a CEO or anyone else with a bad attitude, and I would really appreciate it if anyone who doesn’t understand that philosophy would stay as far away from me as possible!!\n             </p>\n             <p>\n             Put another way, I have no respect for insecure people who will do ANYTHING to make themselves feel more important or worthwhile in their own narrow vision of what really matters at anyone’s cost.\n             </p>\n             <p>\n             OK, OK, let’s finish this on a very positive note, and that is that I look forward to continuously working with and meeting as many reliable decent partners and stakeholders as is humanly possible on this journey, while at the same time having some great social philosophical discussions over a few relaxed beers, whenever the opportunity arises.
